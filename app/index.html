                <p class="review-text">Our almost brand new Subaru was totaled in the hail storm in Reading. Since we were unhappy with
                  sales experience from our last purchase, we were leery about stepping out into the car buying arena so soon. However,
                  our Ciocca experience was a very surprising experience. Our salesman Mike Vannote was very knowledgeable about the cars,
                  very personable, and put no pressure on us. He worked with us to get the car we wanted and at a price which we thought was
                  very good, without all the haggling. When we picked up the car is was a very relaxed, professional atmosphere and the car
                  looked great and met all our expectations. We are very happy with our purchase and feel very good about the entire experience.</p>
