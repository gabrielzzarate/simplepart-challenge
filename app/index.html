                <p class="review-text">Our almost brand new Subaru was totaled in the hail storm in Reading. Since we were unhappy with
                  sales experience from our last purchase, we were leery about stepping out into the car buying arena so soon. However,
                  our Ciocca experience was a very surprising experience. Our salesman Mike Vannote was very knowledgeable about the cars,
                  very personable, and put no pressure on us. He worked with us to get the car we wanted and at a price which we thought was
                  very good, without all the haggling. When we picked up the car is was a very relaxed, professional atmosphere and the car
                  looked great and met all our expectations. We are very happy with our purchase and feel very good about the entire experience.</p>

                <p class="review-text">John did an excellent job assessing my needs and recommeding the right vehicle. I felt he was
                being honest with me from the onset which made the experience easier. I have been in sales for over 30 years and don't like to
                waist time going back and forth on price etc. as you usually do in most dealerships. I had an appointment for 1pm and drove the
                vehicle home by 4:00 the same day. I was surprised his manager didn't come in and thank me for my business. I had asked John to
                throw in a set of splash guards on the car and his boss flat out refused. I guess spending $22k for the car couldnt possibly warrant
                a set of splash guards valued at $147.00. He should have come in and explained his reason behind his decision rather than leaving it to
                John to explain.</p>
